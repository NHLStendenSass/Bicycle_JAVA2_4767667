## Description:

The NS Group wants new software to track the rental of their bicycles. The software should track how many **bicycles** are still available for rental. There are  three types of bikes: a regular one, mountain bike and electrical bike. A  customer can **hire** a bicycle for a certain amount of time. The end time will be registered when the customer returns the bike. In every bicycle is a **GPStracker**. The tracker tracks the distance the customer has travelled with the bicycle. *When the customers starts renting he has to pay deposit from €20*,-.  The customer has to pay money per kilometre. This is: > €0,20 for a regular bike; > €0,25 for a mountain bike; > €0,50 for a electrical bike. Per hour the customer has to pay €2,-. *When the customer returns the bike,  the customer has to pay*. For maintenance purposes the company wants to  know the total distance the bike has been used.
